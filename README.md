###Equation to Flowchart & Solver
A Python project that converts mathematical equations into flowcharts and calculates their roots.
##Features
- Supports linear, quadratic, and higher-order polynomial equations.
- Automatically generates a step-by-step flowchart showing the solving process.
- Computes and displays real and complex roots of the equation.
- Built using simple Python libraries for easy setup and use.
##Usage
- Run the Python script.
- Input your equation.
- View the generated flowchart and roots of the equation.
##Dependencies
- matplotlib (for visualizing flowcharts)
- sympy
##Acknowledgements
This project was created during my coding journey with **Vibe Coding**.  
Most of the Python code, especially the parts for generating flowcharts and solving equations, was **assisted by AI** 
I have tested and adapted the code manually to ensure it works correctly, and this project reflects both AI assistance and my own efforts in understanding and implementing the solution.
